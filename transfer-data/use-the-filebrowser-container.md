You can drag and drop your local files to your home directory

## Access files from a running container

File uploaded in FileBrowser will be accessible in the `researcher_home` directory, whose location varies depending on whether you are [running-a-jupyter-based-container.md](../running-a-container/running-a-jupyter-based-container.md "mention") or [running-a-container-with-gui.md](../running-a-container/running-a-container-with-gui.md "mention").

## Download files from a running container

Every new file created inside the `researcher_home` directory can be accessed and downloaded from FileBrowser.
